# Colorado Fourteeners

## Usage
Colorado Fourteeners was built as a reference to peaks in Colorado above 14,000'.

This guide lists the peaks in Colorado above 14,000ft with dropdowns giving more detailed information about each peak, including location and rank (by elevation). 

This page allows you to make a list of completed or "bagged" peaks to mark down the peaks as you hike them.
